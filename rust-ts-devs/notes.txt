Why Rust?
- Ergonomics - ergonomics is defined on two axes, one quickly being able to write software with low unexpected behavior, and two, maintain software longer


JavaScripts(TS) vs Rust design decisions
- Specify Readonly vs Specify Mutability
- undefined/null vs Option
- errors being thrown vs being returned

Interfaces 

NOT - properties + methods
IS - just methods that the struct needs to implement for it to satisfy the interface, and allows for composition
